	<p>ðŸ‘‹ I am a computer engineer based in Europe. I did my 
	<a href="https://kluedo.ub.rptu.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/6863">
		PhD work
	</a> 
	at the intersection of formal methods and artificial intelligence.
	Currently, I work at 
	<a href="https://informal.systems">
		Informal Systems
	</a>, assessing correctness of distributed systems protocols and their implementations.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this blog I write about interesting computer science topics that I 
		come across in my work or in the work of others.
		My default topics will be formal methods (and software correctness/security in general),
		artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.
